   - **Mitigation**: Use simple PHP GD library, implement basic validation

2. **Location Services Integration**
   - **Risk**: GPS and map integration may have issues
   - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback manual input, use Google Maps API

3. **Performance with JSON Storage**
   - **Risk**: JSON file storage may become slow with large datasets
   - **Mitigation**: Implement basic caching, optimize file operations

#### Schedule Risks
1. **Feature Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Adding too many features may delay completion
   - **Mitigation**: Stick to MVP scope, defer non-essential features

2. **Testing Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Testing all features may take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Implement testing throughout development, not just at end

### Quality Assurance

#### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual PHP classes and functions
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Test complete user flows
4. **Performance Testing**: Test response times and scalability
5. **Security Testing**: Test input validation and file upload security

#### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All code must pass review before moving to next phase
- **Testing Completion**: All tests must pass before phase completion
- **Performance Validation**: Response times must meet requirements
- **Security Review**: Security vulnerabilities must be addressed
