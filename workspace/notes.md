### Important Reminders

#### Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Secure file upload handling
- [ ] Session timeout and security
- [ ] XSS prevention measures

#### Performance Notes
- [ ] Optimize image processing for large files
- [ ] Implement basic caching for JSON data
- [ ] Minimize database queries (JSON file reads)
- [ ] Optimize mobile image loading
- [ ] Consider lazy loading for listings

#### Mobile Experience
- [ ] Test camera capture on various devices
- [ ] Ensure GPS works on mobile browsers
- [ ] Optimize touch interactions
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify mobile form usability

#### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Verify mobile browser compatibility
- [ ] Check JavaScript ES6 support
- [ ] Test CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- [ ] Verify HTML5 form features

### Technical Decisions Made

#### UI Framework Choice
- **Selected**: Bulma CSS Framework
- **Reason**: Clean, modern design with excellent responsive features
- **Alternative Considered**: Vanilla Framework (Ubuntu)
- **Decision**: Bulma provides better component library and documentation

#### Data Storage Strategy
- **Selected**: JSON files with organized folder structure
- **Reason**: Simple deployment, no database setup required
- **Alternative Considered**: SQLite database
- **Decision**: JSON files allow for easy backup and deployment

#### Image Processing
- **Selected**: PHP GD library
- **Reason**: Built into PHP, no external dependencies
- **Alternative Considered**: ImageMagick
- **Decision**: GD library sufficient for prototype needs

#### Location Services
- **Selected**: Google Maps JavaScript API
- **Reason**: Comprehensive mapping and geocoding
- **Alternative Considered**: OpenStreetMap
- **Decision**: Google Maps provides better user experience

### Development Challenges

#### Image Upload Security
- **Challenge**: Preventing malicious file uploads
- **Solution**: Strict file type validation, size limits, image processing
- **Status**: Planned for implementation

#### Location Accuracy
- **Challenge**: GPS accuracy varies by device and environment
- **Solution**: Allow manual coordinate input, validate coordinates
- **Status**: Planned for implementation

#### JSON File Performance
- **Challenge**: Large JSON files may become slow to read/write
- **Solution**: Implement basic caching, optimize file operations
- **Status**: Planned for implementation

#### Mobile Camera Integration
- **Challenge**: Camera API support varies by device and browser
- **Solution**: Graceful fallback to file upload, feature detection
- **Status**: Planned for implementation

### Code Quality Standards

#### PHP Standards
- Use PSR-12 coding standards
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Implement input validation for all user inputs

#### JavaScript Standards
- Use ES6+ features where supported
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Implement proper event handling

#### CSS Standards
- Use BEM methodology for class naming
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Optimize for mobile-first design
