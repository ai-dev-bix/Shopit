## üö´ PHASE 2 BLOCKERS

The following issues **MUST** be resolved before proceeding to Phase 2:

1. ‚úÖ Missing `Listing.php` class
2. ‚úÖ Missing `Order.php` class  
3. ‚úÖ Incomplete API implementation
4. ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities
5. ‚úÖ Core functionality gaps

---

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Next 24 hours)
1. Create missing core classes
2. Implement basic security fixes
3. Set up proper error handling

### Short-term (Next 3 days)
1. Complete API implementation
2. Implement core marketplace features
3. Add comprehensive validation

### Long-term (Phase 2)
1. Performance optimization
2. User experience improvements
3. Advanced features implementation

---

**Conclusion**: While the foundation and architecture are excellent, Phase 1 has critical gaps that prevent the prototype from functioning. These must be addressed before proceeding to Phase 2 development.

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 2** until all critical issues are resolved. The current codebase is a good foundation but requires significant completion work to be functional.
