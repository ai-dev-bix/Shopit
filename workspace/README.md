## Project Status
- **Phase**: Initial Planning & Architecture
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Next Milestone**: Complete PRD and Technical Architecture

## Key Decisions Made
1. **UI Framework**: Bulma CSS framework for clean, responsive design
2. **Data Storage**: JSON files in /data subfolders for prototype simplicity
3. **Backend**: PHP for server communication and data handling
4. **Deployment**: Simple zip extraction for Plesk subdirectory deployment
5. **Authentication**: Simple username-based system with admin accounts

## Team Structure
- **Project Manager**: AI Assistant (me)
- **Frontend Developer**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bulma
- **Backend Developer**: PHP with JSON data handling
- **UX Designer**: User experience and interface design
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and quality assurance
