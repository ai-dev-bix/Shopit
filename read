First, brainstorming

We are planning to develop an application where a user can capture images for a product or service, add name, description, number of units (if applicable for this service or product, and if it is activated the client can show the number of units left) and cost per unit, hour, day, other., he can also add tags to that. There is also a button that detect the user's location (he can manually change the Lat and long if he needs to as well, then he posts that. Another option there is opening the ability to book a time to get the service (the customer can book a time from available slots). The supplier can decide if the product purchase requires sales approval or not. If it does, the sales will be formal once the supplier approves the customer request to buy. If sales approval is not requires then the sales takes place once the customer buys it. The payment is made on purchase date. It is locked in the system account till the delivery time due. If both the buyer and the seller confirms the sales as complete, the money moves to the seller account. If not, and any of the two parties requests moving the money to his account, the other has to approve it, and if that doesn't happen, the one blocking the completion of the transfer can start a dispute in 72 hours and each side present his case for the system admins to judge on the transfer. If the one blocking the transfer does not present his case Another user browsing the products and services in the system, can filter how close the distance he wants to filter accordingly (the radius), price min and max, multi tags... Then if he finds what he wants, he can go thru the purchase operation.

Second, a primary PRD draft:

1.	Cancellation/refund policy: The seller decides the cancelation conditions (for example: 1)once purchased, cant cancel. Or 2) Cancelation allowed # of hours before delivery time or after purchase confirmed. or 3) cancelation allowed anytime before sales completion. And the client can see that condition in the product description - the system reacts to cancelation request accordingly).
2.	Payment providers – Stripe/PayPal or other integrations via api
4.	Commission model – fixed fee, % fee, or hybrid, the system admin sets the rates from the backend.
5.	Booking: we need support for recurring services (weekly/monthly)
